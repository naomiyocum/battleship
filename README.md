## General Info
Battleship was a paired project assigned to us during week 2 of Mod 1 of 4 in Turing's School of Software & Design.
Our challenge was to use Ruby to build a command line implementation of the classic game [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).<br><br>
Battleship is a classic board game where players place one or more ships on a grid board, and then take turns trying to ‚Äúsink‚Äù the other player‚Äôs ships by guessing their coordinates.
The game ends when one player‚Äôs ships are all hit and ‚Äúsunk‚Äù.

## Learning Goals
* Utilize Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Practice algorithmic thinking
* Create an Object-Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
* Work in a pair, using Pull Requests to collaborate

## Technologies
* Ruby 2.7
* RSpec
* Pry
* SimpleCov
* Git
* Atom

## Usage :ship:
You need to clone the project onto your local machine and run the file.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:naomiyocum/battleship.git
cd battleship
ruby battleship_runner.rb
```
After running these commands, you should see a prompt welcoming you to the game!

After entering `p`, you will be prompted to place your ships, similar to the image below.<br><br>

After ship placement, you and the computer will take turns attempting to hit each other's battleships. May the odds be in your favor.
