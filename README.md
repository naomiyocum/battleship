## General Info
Battleship was a paired project assigned to us during week 2 of Mod 1 of 4 in Turing's School of Software & Design.
Our challenge was to use Ruby to build a command line implementation of the classic game [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).<br><br>
Battleship is a classic board game where players place one or more ships on a grid board, and then take turns trying to “sink” the other player’s ships by guessing their coordinates.
The game ends when one player’s ships are all hit and “sunk”.
